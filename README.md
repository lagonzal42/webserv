The Webserv project involves building a minimalistic web server capable of handling HTTP requests, parsing configuration files, supporting various HTTP methods (such as GET, POST), managing concurrency, and serving static files.

## Features

- **HTTP Request Handling**: Implement handling for various HTTP methods and request types.
- **Configuration Parsing**: Parse configuration files to customize server settings.
- **Concurrency Management**: Manage multiple client connections concurrently.
- **Static File Serving**: Serve static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to clients.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/webserv.git`
2. Compile the source code: `make`
3. Run the server: `./webserv`

## Usage

- Customize server settings in the configuration file (`webserv.conf`).
- Place static files in the designated directory for serving.
- Access the server via a web browser or HTTP client.
